Starting my first "real" project. I'm excited and confident. 
It will be a website about recipes (according to the Odin Project Tutorial).
(PS, when I made the new recipe repository, I didn't pick the option to automatically add a README.md file, so I'm doing it now with the "touch" command).

Finished! 
My thoughts? I feel accomplished. I'm quite amazed at the Odin Project and it's ability to teach me honestly.
